# COWnters

COWnters is a website used to find counters to specific heroes in Overwatch.

## Thanks

We use the [Minima][0] theme, which was developed by [Jekyll][1], with a few changes
of our own to fit our needs.

A lot of our data was retrieved from the official [PlayOverwatch][2] website and the [Overwatch.guide][3] website.
